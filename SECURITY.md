## Third Party Security Audits
Category Labs engages third party audit firms to conduct independent security audits of their implementation of the Monad client. At any given time, multiple audit streams can be in progress.

As these third party audits are completed and issues are sufficiently addressed, we make those audit reports public. Audits can be found in the [monad-audits](https://github.com/category-labs/monad-audits) repository.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
We are committed to maintaining the security and integrity of our codebase and appreciate the security research community’s efforts in helping us achieve this goal. If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in our codebase, we encourage responsible disclosure through the process outlined below.

**DO NOT** report critical security vulnerabilities through public channels, including GitHub issues or public forums.

**Instead, email us at: security@category.xyz with “VULNERABILITY: “ in the subject line.**

Please include the following information in your report:

-   Detailed description of the vulnerability    
-   Step-by-step reproduction instructions
-   Assessment of potential security impact and exploitation scenarios
-   Proof-of-concept code or exploit demonstration (if possible)
-   Your preferred contact information for follow-up communications

Submissions must include a proof-of-concept or they will be rejected without review.

### Responsible Disclosure Policy
We adhere to industry-standard responsible disclosure principles and request that researchers do the same.

1.  Vulnerabilities should be submitted through private channels to our security team
2.  Allow reasonable time for investigation, validation, and remediation
3.  Mutual coordination on public disclosure timelines
4.  Confidentiality until patches are deployed and disclosure is authorized

### Scope Limitations

The following issues are considered outside the scope of our vulnerability disclosure program:

-   Social engineering or phishing attacks    
-   Physical security vulnerabilities
-   Denial of service (DoS) attacks
-   Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (except where they create a protocol-level security issues
-   Issues requiring unauthorized physical access to systems or infrastructure
-   Theoretical vulnerabilities without demonstrated exploitation paths
-   Vulnerabilities related to smart contracts, dApps, or anything else not included in this codebase
-   Previously reported and acknowledged vulnerabilities
